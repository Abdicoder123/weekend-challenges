-----------

#### Requirements:

For this project, there are several requirements:

1. User Input: Provide a text input field for users to enter the location (city or zip code) they want to check the weather for. Include a "Search" button.

2. AJAX Request: When the user clicks the "Search" button, use AJAX to make a request to a weather API ( OpenWeatherMap) with the user's input.

3. Display Weather: After a successful response from the API, display the weather forecast information on the page. Include details like:
    - temperature (e.g *56F*)
    - weather (e.g *Clouds*)
    - conditions (e.g *overcast clouds*)
    - humidity (e.g *83*)
    - wind speed (e.g *6.71 mph*)

4. Error Handling: Implement error handling to display a message if the location is not found or if there are network issues. (e.g. `Network error. Please try again later.`)

5. User Interface: Create an appealing user interface with clear and organized weather information. You can use HTML, CSS, and jQuery to format and style the content.All code should be in separate files (script.js, style.css, & index.html)._have fun with this and maybe add some emojis_
